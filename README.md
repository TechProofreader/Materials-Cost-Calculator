# Materials-Cost-Calculator

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechProofreader/Materials-Cost-Calculator/master/MaterialsCostCalcMainScreen.png)

This is a script that I wrote with Python 3.7.3 that takes user inputs related to a construction/renovation project and outputs a total cost of materials for said project. The output is based on the user's inputs related to the length and width of the project, the cost-per-unit of the project (think dollars per square-foot, for example), and sales tax if the user knows their local sales tax rate and would like for the sales tax to be included in the total cost of their project.

I left out all currency designations because they are unnecessary for an input/output computation that is based solely on math. I also kept the calculations to 2-D space because the most common type of calculation related to construction/renovation projects pertains to flooring plans, as walls (which would constitute the 3-D space) are frequently calculated separately.

The goal of this script is to shorten the time it takes to calculate cost estimates for construction/renovation projects, especially related to flooring. Rather than mashing the buttons on a calculator all day long and converting tax rates, you can simply answer the prompts of this script and it does all of the work for you.
