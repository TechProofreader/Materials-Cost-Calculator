# Materials-Cost-Calculator

This is a script written with Python 3.7 that takes user inputs related to a construction/renovation project and outputs a total cost of materials for said project. The output is based on the user's inputs related to the length and width of the project, the cost-per-unit of the project (think dollars per square-foot, for example), and sales tax if the user knows the number and would like for the sales tax to be included in the total cost of their project.

I left out all currency designations because they are unnecessary for an input/output computation that is based solely on math. I also kept the calculations to 2-D space because the most common type of calculation related to construction/renovation projects pertains to flooring plans, as walls (which would constitute the 3-D space) are frequently calculated separately.

The goal of this script is to shorten the time it takes to calculate cost estimates for construction/renovation projects.
